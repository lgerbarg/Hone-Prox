## Hone Prox

# Intro 
Hone Prox is a simple utility intended to allow users to trigger programs on when a Hone goes into or out of range of their Macintosh. It is also intended to serve as a quick example of how to write an app that interacts with a Hone, as such the intent was to keep it simple and clean rather than implement a ton of features. A binary build can be downloaded from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/devwhy/HoneProx.zip).

# Usage
You can "pair" a Hone by hitting the pair button, Hone Prox will display the system UUID of the closest Hone and offer to pair. This is not a true BLE cryptographic pairing, just a record of the devices address.
